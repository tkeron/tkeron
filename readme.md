## Monorepo Structure

Tkeron is organized as a monorepository, allowing for a unified development and version control process across its various modules and components.

The monorepo is structured to host multiple packages, each of which serves a specific purpose within the Tkeron ecosystem. Each package in its own directory in the root.

Actions are executed on every package directory change.
